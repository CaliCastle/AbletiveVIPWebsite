>*Everything rebuilt and re-designed just to make it clean and tidy! :)*

### Demonstration website: [vip.abletive.com](http://vip.abletive.com)
*(Only available to Abletive VIPs)*

### Warnings:
- The `User Authentication and Registration APIs` are maintained only in Abletive main site, due to security and privacy reasons
the code is written in the vendor files by Cali and is **NOT INCLUDED** in this repo. 
You can tinker around by manually creating `User` model via `php artisan tinker`
Or, simply change the code a bit. Have fun playing around :)
